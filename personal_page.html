<p>Hello, my name is Hayley and I am a student from Belfast. I am studying Interaction Design, also known as #IXD,  in the University of Ulster.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite things include watching movies, listening to music. Spotify is the best creation ever to be invented! I love grabbing images when and where I can, images last forever. I also have a thing for Arabic language, weird yes, but Im committed. I made a point of getting a tattoo of it. </p>
    
<p> Creativity is key to me and being unique is what I love, why go with the trend? thats just boring.</p>

    <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
    
     <p> In one word I would describe my work as "Random". I do what I feel at the time, the outcome is always different. However looking through my work I can  see a house style developing.</p> 
         
     <p> As a young girl I was obsessed with spirograph and loved how the stencils created interesting, effortless patterns. This gave me inspiration. I took this element and processed it into a digital form. </p> 
     
<p class="work2"> I am still experimenting with my work and discovering the type of designer I want to be. I know I am going in the right direction. To view more   work Just click my Flickr link below!
